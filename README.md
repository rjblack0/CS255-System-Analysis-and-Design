Project Summary

The DriverPass project was designed for a client seeking a online driving education platform that would help students to succeed in their own time. The requirements for the system were that it would allow students to schedule driving lessons, take practice tests, and receive feedback from instructors. The platform also needed administrative functions, including managing instructors, processing payments, and generating reports. The goal was to increase student success rates on driving exams by offering both theoretical and practical preparation in a structured, user-friendly system.

Project Strengths

One of the strongest aspects of my work was the thorough documentation and clear, structured diagrams. The UML diagrams—including use case, activity, sequence, and class diagrams— outlined system functionality and user interactions. I was also able to convey the workings of this system clearly, ensuring that the client could easily understand the system’s design without technical expertise.

Areas for Improvement & Revision

One area where I feel that I need improvement is in the technical requirements section of the system design document. While I covered the necessary hardware, software, and security aspects, I could improve on how I describe system maintenance expectations and add more specific performance benchmarks.

Understanding & Implementing User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by carefully analyzing the client’s business requirements document and interview transcript. This helped me to prioritize the users key requirements; ease of access, mobile compatibility, and security. Understanding the user’s needs is critical because a system that is not intuitive will not be accepted in a culture that is accustomed to easy, usable software. By focusing on usability and role-based access, I ensured that each user type (students, instructors, and admins) had the necessary tools to perform their tasks efficiently.

Approach to Software Design & Future Strategies

My approach to designing software is to first understand the nature of the problem and user expectations before I begin to structure the solution. I prefer to use process modeling techniques, like UML diagrams, to visually map out how different components will interact. 

Moving forward, I plan to:

Prioritize iterative feedback— regularly checking with stakeholders to refine the system before final implementation.
Leverage more prototyping— creating early wireframes to validate usability before committing to full development.
Improve documentation practices— ensuring that all design elements are well-documented for future developers and maintainers.
